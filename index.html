    <h1>Why Columbia, SC Sucks</h1>
    <p>Let’s be honest — not every city is perfect. Here are a few reasons why Columbia, South Carolina might not be everyone's cup of sweet tea:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>It's Hot. Like, Really Hot.</strong><br>
            If you enjoy sweating through your shirt before 9 AM, you're in luck! Columbia turns into an oven every summer — and spring... and fall.</li>
        <li><strong>The Traffic Makes No Sense.</strong><br>
            Want to sit at a red light with no other cars around? Columbia has you covered.</li>
        <li><strong>Everything Closes Early.</strong><br>
            Planning a late-night snack run? Sorry — Columbia's probably already asleep.</li>
        <li><strong>It Floods. A Lot.</strong><br>
            Rainy day? You might need a canoe. Or maybe just build an ark.</li>
        <li><strong>The Smell Near the Riverfront.</strong><br>
            You’ll know it when you smell it. Trust us.</li>
        <li><strong>The State House Vibes.</strong><br>
            The political energy downtown is... tense, to say the least.</li>
        <li><strong>Where’s the Fun?</strong><br>
            Sure, there are a few bars and a zoo, but the excitement level is closer to “Sunday afternoon nap.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of course, if you're into brutal heat, political drama, and limited nightlife, Columbia might just be your paradise!</p>
